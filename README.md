# Bluebike-Analysis
This is our final project for DS4200 that features an interactive webpage that analyzes Bluebike trip data to reveal MBTA inefficiencies in the greater Boston area. Various visualizations were made including a sankey diagram, folium map, Altair graph, and D3 bar graph. 

## Usage
To run the webpage, simply run the index.html file under the ```website/website``` folder.
